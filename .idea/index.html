        In the current task, you will be given a category, and will be asked to list as many items from the category as you can.
        For instance, if the category is instruments, you should list as many instruments as you can recall.
    </p>
    <p>You will have 2 minutes to list as many items from the category as possible.</p>
    <p>Please rely only on memory, and do not search the Internet for answers.</p>
    <p>Do not enter the same item twice in one round, and do not list two items that only differentiate in suffix.
        For example if you list "guitar", do not list "guitars" in the same round.</p>
    <p>Please click the arrow to start.</p>
